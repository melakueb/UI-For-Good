# Describe the project  
Lotus is a web-based networking platform aimed to support wrongfully convicted individuals in reintegrating into the workforce and rebuilding their digital identity post-incarceration. Research shows that most people who are absolved of charges face unique and profound reentry challenges into the workforce. [Michelle Estes, Department of Sociology & Political Science at Tennessee Tech University, conducted a qualitative study to evaluate how wrongful convictions impact education, training, and employment opportunity over time](https://doi.org/10.1080/10509674.2023.2213690).   

Interviewing exonerees from various backgrounds, including both individuals who were convicted before entering the workforce and individuals with a solid work history, the following findings were highlighted:  

- While incarcerated, access to educational programs, updated training materials, and career preparation is often restricted or entirely unavailable. Because release may occur suddenly once a case is overturned, many wrongfully convicted individuals reenter society without any reentry planning, career transition support, or digital literacy resources.  
- Their educational and employment trajectories are disrupted, sometimes permanently, and they must immediately begin explaining long résumé gaps, outdated skills, or outdated technology competencies.  
- The stigma of incarceration follows individuals even after their names are cleared. Employers, community members, and digital search results often continue to associate them with a conviction they did not commit.  
- With few structured services available specifically for the wrongfully convicted population, many navigate these barriers entirely alone.  

Lotus directly responds to these documented needs. The platform provides a safe, empowering space where individuals can:  
- Rebuild and control their digital footprint, countering stigma.  
- Highlight their skills, goals, interests, and stories beyond the case narrative.  
- Share ongoing Bloom Updates that communicate growth, success, and humanity.  
- Access curated upskilling resources to compensate for lost educational opportunities.  
- Explore fair-chance employment channels.  
- Receive supportive positive affirmations that promote psychological well-being during reintegration.

# Present your design work  

## User stories  
Based on findings from Estes (2023), the following user stories were developed:

**As a wrongfully convicted individual, I want to…**  
- present myself online in a way that reflects who I am today rather than letting my wrongful conviction dominate my digital identity,  
- showcase my goals, skills, interests, and accomplishments so employers can see my potential,  
- share updates about my growth through Bloom Updates to rebuild a positive digital footprint, and  
- connect with others who understand reentry challenges and access upskilling opportunities to restart my career path.  

**As an employer or partner, I want to…**  
- understand applicants beyond court documents to make more informed decisions,  
- find individuals who are actively learning, rebuilding their skills, and ready to return to the workforce,  
- and view a clean, narrative-focused profile instead of outdated or case-related search results.  

For this project, Lotus currently focuses primarily on the user stories of wrongfully convicted individuals. In the future, the UI and feature set will be expanded to better support employers, community organizations, innocence networks, and reentry partners.

## Sketching  
The lotus flower symbolizes:  
- rebirth  
- resilience  
- emergence from difficult conditions  
- transformation  
- renewal  

Just as a lotus rises cleanly from muddy waters, wrongfully convicted individuals deserve a new chance to define a better future for themselves. The platform embodies this symbolism through its color palette.  

Lotus is social-media styled and is largely inspired by platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter in the way it is laid out.
